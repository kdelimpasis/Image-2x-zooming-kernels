# Image-2x-zooming-kernels
This code calculates the kernels of several interpolation methods for 2D image zooming 2x. Most of the methods are well known. However we also provide the kernels for a least utilized method: Hermite coordinate interpolation.
The generic concept of 2x image zooming with convolution-based interpolation entails 3 kernels as shown in the Fig. below.
